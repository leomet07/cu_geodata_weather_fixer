### Temperature Difference Averaged For NY Lakes

This folder contains files for determining the temperature difference between the surface temperature of lakes and the temperature at 850mb. On a high level, the script requests the user to input a lake and timeframe, and the script then samples temperatures from the lake uniformly, finding the difference in temperature at each (latitude, longitude), and averaging them.

To gain a step-by-step understanding of the tools used for this, consult the notebook "lakeTemperatureNY.ipynb"

To run the all-in-one script, follow the directions for setting up the environment in "environment.yml", and then run "lakeTemperatureScript.py"
