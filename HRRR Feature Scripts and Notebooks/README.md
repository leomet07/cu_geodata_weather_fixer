### Scripts for pulling data on NY Lakes

As of now, this folder contains files for determining temperature difference and wind shear direction difference between the surface of a chosen lake and at 850mb. On a high level, the script requests the user to input a lake and the timeframe, and then the script samples data from the lake uniformly, then returns the averaged data for the timeframe and lake.

The step-by-step explanations of the tools used for each script are in each of the corresponding notebooks. The first and best-documented notebook is "lakeTemperatureNY.ipynb"; other notebooks reuse tools from it and have less explanation.

To run the all-in-one scripts, follow the directions for setting up the environment in "environment.yml", and then run "lakeTemperatureScript.py"

Further updates with new scripts and new notebooks will come later.
